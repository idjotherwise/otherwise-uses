        I am a data scientist specialising in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. My background is in pure mathematics, having received my PhD in 2019. More recently, I am focused on software development with Julia for statistical inference.

<p>When I am not playing around with data, I enjoy building small websites (with fastAPI and React usually), skiing in Vorarlberg / Tyrol, and playing games.</p>

  nlp-otherwise (github pages powered by fastpages) where my python notebooks get turned into posts, mostly exploring Covid19 data. There I also list a few more of my websites
